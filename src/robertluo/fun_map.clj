(defn fun-map
  "Returns a new fun-map.

  A fun-map is a special map which will automatically *unwrap* a value if it's a
  wrapper when accessed by key. A wrapper is anything which wrapped a ordinary value
  inside. Many clojure data structures are wrapper, such as atom, ref, future, delay,
  agent etc. In fact, anything implements clojure.lang.IDRef interface is a wrapper.

  FuntionWrapper is another wrapper can be used in a fun-map, which wraps a function,
  it will be called with the fun-map itself as the argument.

  Map m is the underlying storage of a fun-map, fun-map does not change its property
  except accessing values.

  Options:

   - :trace-fn An Effectful function for globally FunctionWrapper calling trace which
     accept key and value as its argument.

  Example:

    (fun-map {:a 35 :b (delay (println \"hello from b!\"))}"
  [m & {:keys [trace-fn]}]
  (with-meta
    (impl/delegate-map m)
    {::impl/trace trace-fn}))

(defn touch
  "Forcefully evaluate all entries of a map and returns itself."
  [m]
  (doseq [[_ _] m] nil)
  m)

(defn lookup
  "Returns a semi Associative instance by mapping single arity function f as
  argument to return value."
  [f]
  (impl/lookup f))

(defmacro fw
  "Returns a FunctionWrapper of an anonymous function defined by body.

   Since a FunctionWrapper's function will be called with the map itself as the
   argument, this macro using a map `arg-map` as its argument. It follows the
   same syntax of clojure's associative destructure. You may use `:keys`, `:as`,
   `:or` inside.

   Special key `:wrappers` specify additional wrappers of function wrapper:

    - `[]` for naive one, no cache, no trace.
    - default to specable cached traceable implementation. which supports special keys:
      - `:spec` a spec that the value must conform.
      - `:focus` A form that will be called to check if the function itself need
        to be called. It must be pure functional and very effecient.
      - `:trace` A trace function, if the value updated, it will be called with key
        and the function's return value.

   Special option `:par? true` will make dependencies accessing parallel.

   Example:

    (fw {:keys  [a b]
         :as    m
         :trace (fn [k v] (println k v))
         :focus (select-keys m [:a :b])}
      (+ a b))"

  `args` key of the fun-map, it will *focus* on the keys also."
